# Decision-Tree-with-scikit-learn
My project in CS420-Artificial Intelligence course.

Purpose:
- Using scikit-learn library to a build decision tree on the UCI Connect-4 Dataset.
- With 2 programs, try to figure out the different performance with different proportion train/test and impact of max-depth of decision tree.
